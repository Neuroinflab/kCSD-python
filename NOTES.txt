Preparing for release
Moved functions from KCSD1D_Helpers etc into something more sane.
Using **kwargs instead of params to pass agruments
Saner method names.

Comments for future
1) Possibility to use errfunc instead of gaussian

Pushing KCSD1D + tests to beta phase

Comments for future
0) Write unit tests and facilitate regression tests for future.
1) Write test_kCSDx.py as a class
2) The gaussian source normalization, see guass_rescale_xD function.
3) Better uniform way to generate csd_profiles, across 3 dims. For legacy reasons, left as it is for now.
4) Better names for functions and variables? (k.update_b_interp_pot, and k_interp_cross etc)

Pushing KCSD3D + tests to beta phase

REASON for such absurd merging from tags is as follows
1) intended to not inclue the test_kcsd2d cases
2.1) someone asked as to how they can trust the method
2.2) someone asked if the default values in kcsd2d method have any meaning - which they dont
3) in two separate instances, gave the code to the respective people hence multiple versions
4) unable to keep up with multiple versions, now including this in trunk.
